## The problem

The City of Bloomington operated an outdated in-house content management system that had served for a decade. Key problems included:

- Departments duplicating pages to maintain visibility within their sections
- Centralized content management by single designees in each office, creating dependency risks
- Need for better integration with open-source municipal tools
- Limited budget and resources within the IT department

## Design approach

### Research & validation

The team conducted open research including resident interviews, staff consultations, and service mapping across departments. Notably, we printed site sections and **facilitated in-person voting exercises in a local supermarket** to test comprehension, navigation, and language with actual residents.

### Information architecture

I reorganized the site structure **around resident tasks rather than departmental divisions**. This allowed us to simplify content and establish more sustainable governance—residents don't care which department handles their request, they care about getting their question answered or task completed.

### Implementation

Close coordination between design and development ensured accessibility and durability while supporting long-term maintenance by city staff with limited technical resources.

## Outcomes

Post-launch metrics demonstrated significant improvement:
- **Exit rates decreased 11%**
- **Bounce rate decreased 93%**
- **Mobile usage exceeded 50%** of total traffic

The project earned the **2018 Best of Indiana Award** and was featured at **DrupalCon Nashville 2018**.

## What this demonstrates

I can lead municipal digital transformation with constrained resources. I understand that successful government websites require not just good design, but information architecture that reflects how residents actually think about services—and governance structures that city staff can sustain long-term.
