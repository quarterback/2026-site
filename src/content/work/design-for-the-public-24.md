## The vision

I organized a two-day unconference-style event to bring together civic technologists and designers who wanted to participate in conversations about what we build and envision future directions for public-facing work.

## Event details

Over **80 participants** from across the United States attended the October 16-17, 2024 gathering. The conference spanned two locations with an unconference format, splitting programming between venues to encourage diverse conversations and networking.

I coordinated speakers, selected locations, programmed the schedule, and delivered the opening keynote for day one.

## Collaboration & timing

The event was co-produced with **Technologists for Public Good** and strategically timed to overlap with Portland Design Month's inaugural year—an initiative I helped launch while serving as Board President of AIGA Portland.

## Outcome

The event successfully created a gathering space for practitioners focused on designing technology and services that serve public interests, fostering meaningful dialogue about civic innovation and design's role in shaping community futures.

## What this demonstrates

I can convene communities around shared purpose. I understand that advancing public sector design requires not just individual projects, but sustained community infrastructure that connects practitioners across contexts.
