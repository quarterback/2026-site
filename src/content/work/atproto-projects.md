## Institutional Design in Public Environments

This suite of projects demonstrates how decision systems, authority models, and trust infrastructure operate when they must be publicly visible, auditable, and contestable. Built on AT Protocol's decentralized foundation, these systems show what governance architecture looks like in environments where no central authority can dictate outcomes—where accountability must be designed into the system itself.

The work explores a core challenge: **how do you build governable systems in public contexts?** Not user-facing services, but the trust scaffolding and decision-layer architecture that makes public systems legible, accountable, and safe to operate.

Shared governance principles across all projects:

- **Transparency as infrastructure**: Decision logic, data sources, and authority models must be publicly auditable
- **Decentralized accountability**: Trust and governance mechanisms that function without centralized control
- **Contestability by design**: Users can challenge, verify, and audit system behavior
- **No surveillance**: Privacy-preserving architecture that doesn't require data extraction to function

## Projects in This Suite

### [HeyPBJ — Structured Matching Platform](/work/heypbj-matching-platform)
A structured-matching platform that treats dating and social discovery as a routing problem rather than a feed. Uses declared preferences, weighted signals, and compatibility metrics to place people into small cohorts ("rundles") where interaction happens through guided prompts instead of endless swiping. Explores constraint-based matching, transparent criteria, and small-group dynamics for more humane online connections.

### [Glowrm — Trust & Relationship Layer](/work/glowrm-trust-layer)
Trust infrastructure demonstrating how governance primitives—verification, credentialing, accountability—function in decentralized environments where no platform controls authority. Shows how trust routing, reputation portability, and consent enforcement operate as decision-layer architecture rather than centralized platform features. Establishes the governance models needed when authority must be distributed but accountability still matters.

### [Leafroll — Professional Identity Layer](/work/leafroll-professional-identity)
Lightweight professional-identity and portfolio system that rethinks how people present work, skills, and trajectory outside traditional résumé formats. Treats profiles as living documents composed of signals, artifacts, and endorsements that can be rearranged depending on context—collaboration, hiring, or discovery. Experiments with modular profiles, structured metadata, and social proof that can travel across networks as dynamic, composable records.

## Shared Architecture Patterns

**AT Protocol Foundation:**
- Decentralized identity (users own their data)
- User-controlled data repositories
- Composable schemas and services
- Portable credentials and reputation

**Multiple Deployment Strategies:**
- **Progressive web apps** (HeyPBJ, Leafroll): Client-side rendering with offline support
- **Infrastructure services** (Glowrm): Trust/verification APIs for other platforms
- All prioritize **user control** and **data portability**

**Transparency & Privacy First:**
- No tracking or analytics
- Published methodology and data sources
- AI usage disclosure where applicable
- User-controlled permissions and consent
- Cryptographic verification for trust claims

## Why AT Protocol?

AT Protocol provides:
- **Decentralized identity**: Users own their data and can move between services
- **Composable data**: Repositories can reference and build on each other
- **Public infrastructure**: Open protocols enable innovation without permission

These projects explore how to build public goods on decentralized foundations—proving patterns for data infrastructure, benchmarking, and experimental interfaces that don't require centralized platforms.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Institutional design for public contexts**: How decision systems, authority models, and trust scaffolding function when governance must be publicly visible and contestable
- **Public mechanics at scale**: Demonstrating the choreography between technical architecture, authority delegation, and accountability in environments where centralized control isn't an option
- **Trust infrastructure as governance**: Building the primitives—verification, reputation routing, consent enforcement—that let decentralized systems operate with institutional accountability
- **Authority models without platforms**: Showing how credibility, oversight, and enforcement function when distributed across network participants rather than controlled centrally
- **Decision-layer architecture**: Establishing how judgment routing, consequence design, and override mechanisms operate in public environments where every decision must be auditable
- **Composable governance primitives**: Creating infrastructure that services build on (HeyPBJ uses Glowrm, Leafroll integrates trust routing) rather than implementing governance in silos
