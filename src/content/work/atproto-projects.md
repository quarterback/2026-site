## Overview

This is a suite of interconnected projects exploring decentralized protocols, public data infrastructure, and experimental interfaces. All projects share common principles:

- **Public by default**: Open data, transparent methods
- **Decentralized where possible**: Using AT Protocol and distributed architectures
- **Experimental posture**: Rapid iteration, learning in public
- **No tracking**: Privacy-first, minimal data collection

## Projects in This Suite

### [HeyPBJ — Structured Matching Platform](/work/heypbj-matching-platform)
A structured-matching platform that treats dating and social discovery as a routing problem rather than a feed. Uses declared preferences, weighted signals, and compatibility metrics to place people into small cohorts ("rundles") where interaction happens through guided prompts instead of endless swiping. Explores constraint-based matching, transparent criteria, and small-group dynamics for more humane online connections.

### [Glowrm — Trust & Relationship Layer](/work/glowrm-trust-layer)
Trust and relationship-layer prototype for AT Protocol environments. Provides lightweight infrastructure for signaling credibility, tracking interaction history, and routing trust between participants and communities. Focuses on how identity, reputation, and consent travel across networks without collapsing into a single platform's control. Experiments with portable trust primitives—verification, vouching, and context establishment when moving between spaces.

### [Leafroll — Professional Identity Layer](/work/leafroll-professional-identity)
Lightweight professional-identity and portfolio system that rethinks how people present work, skills, and trajectory outside traditional résumé formats. Treats profiles as living documents composed of signals, artifacts, and endorsements that can be rearranged depending on context—collaboration, hiring, or discovery. Experiments with modular profiles, structured metadata, and social proof that can travel across networks as dynamic, composable records.

### [Occupant — AI Compute Benchmarks](/work/occupant-ai-benchmarks)
Public data infrastructure for AI model pricing, compute deflation tracking (CPI), economic activity indices (AEAI), and market intelligence. Daily-updated benchmarks tracking 2,300+ AI models across providers for procurement and strategic planning. Static site with scheduled data regeneration via GitHub Actions—no database, no tracking, just public benchmarks.

## Shared Architecture Patterns

**AT Protocol Foundation:**
- Decentralized identity (users own their data)
- User-controlled data repositories
- Composable schemas and services
- Portable credentials and reputation

**Multiple Deployment Strategies:**
- **Static + regeneration** (Occupant): Scheduled pipelines, no runtime server
- **Progressive web apps** (HeyPBJ, Leafroll): Client-side rendering with offline support
- **Infrastructure services** (Glowrm): Trust/verification APIs for other platforms
- All prioritize **user control** and **data portability**

**Transparency & Privacy First:**
- No tracking or analytics
- Published methodology and data sources
- AI usage disclosure where applicable
- User-controlled permissions and consent
- Cryptographic verification for trust claims

---

## Why AT Protocol?

AT Protocol provides:
- **Decentralized identity**: Users own their data and can move between services
- **Composable data**: Repositories can reference and build on each other
- **Public infrastructure**: Open protocols enable innovation without permission

These projects explore how to build public goods on decentralized foundations—proving patterns for data infrastructure, benchmarking, and experimental interfaces that don't require centralized platforms.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Decentralized architecture**: Building connected services without centralized control or platform lock-in
- **Composable infrastructure**: Services that reference and build on each other (HeyPBJ uses Glowrm, Leafroll integrates with both)
- **Portable identity & reputation**: Credentials, trust, and professional history that travel across networks
- **Public data infrastructure**: Creating credible benchmarks and tools as public goods (Occupant)
- **Constraint-based design**: How limits and structure can produce better outcomes than infinite choice (HeyPBJ)
- **Trust primitives**: Building verification, vouching, and consent infrastructure for decentralized spaces (Glowrm)
- **Privacy-first design**: Proving you can build useful services without surveillance or tracking
- **Protocol thinking**: Designing for interoperability and composability from the start
- **Experimental development**: Rapid iteration with transparent methodology, learning in public
