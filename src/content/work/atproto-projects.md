## Overview

This is a suite of interconnected projects exploring decentralized protocols, public data infrastructure, and experimental interfaces. All projects share common principles:

- **Public by default**: Open data, transparent methods
- **Decentralized where possible**: Using AT Protocol and distributed architectures
- **Experimental posture**: Rapid iteration, learning in public
- **No tracking**: Privacy-first, minimal data collection

## Projects in This Suite

### [Occupant — AI Compute Benchmarks](/work/occupant-ai-benchmarks)
Public data infrastructure for AI model pricing, compute deflation tracking (CPI), economic activity indices (AEAI), and market intelligence. Daily-updated benchmarks for procurement and strategic planning.

**Live at:** [occupant.ee](https://occupant.ee)

## Shared Architecture Patterns

**Static + Scheduled Regeneration:**
- No databases or app servers for end users
- GitHub Actions runs scheduled data pipelines
- Results committed to repos and deployed via Pages
- Client-side rendering for interactivity

**Progressive Web Apps:**
- Service workers for offline access
- Manifest files for install prompts
- Works without JavaScript where possible

**Transparency First:**
- Published data sources
- Open methodology
- AI usage disclosure
- Privacy-focused (no analytics/tracking)

## Why AT Protocol?

AT Protocol provides:
- **Decentralized identity**: Users own their data and can move between services
- **Composable data**: Repositories can reference and build on each other
- **Public infrastructure**: Open protocols enable innovation without permission

These projects explore how to build public goods on decentralized foundations—proving patterns for data infrastructure, benchmarking, and experimental interfaces that don't require centralized platforms.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Decentralized architecture**: Building connected services without centralized control
- **Public data infrastructure**: Creating credible benchmarks and tools as public goods
- **Experimental development**: Rapid iteration with transparent methodology
- **Privacy-first design**: Proving you can build useful services without surveillance
- **Protocol thinking**: Designing for interoperability and composability from the start
