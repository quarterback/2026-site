## The problem

Staffing data lived across spreadsheets, tickets, and messages, making comparison and availability hard to track. Delivery teams needed to assign personnel effectively, but fragmented information made it difficult to see who was available, what skills they had, and where they were currently assigned.

## What I built

Nautilus is a staffing decision prototype that addresses workflow challenges in delivery team management. The tool consolidates staffing information by modeling skills, availability, role requirements, and current assignments within a single interface.

The design draws inspiration from crew management software to create a more organized system for team leads and resource managers.

## Interface components

The prototype offers three primary viewing modes:
- **Roster view** for team member overview and skills inventory
- **Timeline view** for availability tracking across team members
- **Comparison view** for evaluating staffing options against role requirements

This allows managers to quickly answer questions like "Who has React and TypeScript experience and is available next month?" without cross-referencing multiple sources.

## Technical stack

React, TypeScript, Supabase backend, AI-assisted development practices

## What this demonstrates

I can identify operational pain points in team management and design tools that consolidate fragmented workflows. I understand that good staffing tools aren't just databases—they're decision support systems that surface the right information at the right time.
