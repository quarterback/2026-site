## Overview

Civic tech often overpromises and underdelivers, focusing on apps or dashboards instead of the systems that quietly keep public life running. This talk introduced **public mechanics** as a framework for seeing the rules, workarounds, and repair practices that hold services together after the launch moment has passed.

## What I covered

- Why civic tech fails when it treats government like a startup problem
- The invisible maintenance work that keeps public services operational
- How to design for repair, not just initial deployment
- Real examples of workarounds that became permanent infrastructure
- A framework for understanding "mechanical" vs. "aesthetic" work in public systems

## Key themes

**Launch culture vs. maintenance reality**
Most civic tech energy goes into new launches. Almost no attention goes to what happens in years 2-10 when the original team is gone and the system needs repair.

**Workarounds as signals**
When people create elaborate workarounds, that's data. It tells you where the official system has failed and where unofficial systems have taken over.

**Public mechanics as practice**
Understanding public services as machines that need routine maintenance, repair documentation, and operational knowledge—not just better UX.

## Impact

- Talk video reached 10K+ views on YouTube
- Framework adopted by several government design teams
- Invited to present similar content at 3 additional conferences
- Led to consulting engagements focused on service sustainability

## What this demonstrates

I can translate complex systems thinking into accessible narratives that resonate with both practitioners and policymakers. This work bridges theory and practice, showing how to think differently about public service design.
