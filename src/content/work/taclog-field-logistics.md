## The problem

Field logistics operations relied on radio- and paper-based processes that were slow and lacked clarity. Supply requisitions in deployed environments needed to work reliably without constant connectivity, with clear visibility into request status and synchronization state.

## What I built

A mobile-first supply requisition prototype addressing logistics challenges I encountered during military engagement with 18F. I leveraged personal military experience to inform both problem identification and design decisions.

The prototype supports **offline-first requisition workflows** on tablets and laptops used in the field, featuring visible request states and synchronization mechanisms suited to actual deployment conditions.

## Key features

- **Request templates** for recurring resupply scenarios
- **Unit-size-based quantity presets** appropriate to field operations
- **Explicit offline queue** showing synchronization status
- Clear visibility into what's been sent, what's queued, and what's pending connection

## Research & development

The development process included:
- Forward-deployed field research with service members
- Cross-functional stakeholder interviews
- Observation of live requisition practices
- Workflow mapping of actual field operations
- Iterative prototyping informed by operational input

**Stack:** React Native with Expo Router, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Row Level Security, offline-capable architecture with queued synchronization

## What this demonstrates

I bring operational context to design work. My military background allows me to identify problems others might miss and build solutions that work under real field constraints—not just ideal conditions.
