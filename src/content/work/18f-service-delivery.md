## Snapshot

**Context:** Federal service delivery systems where policy rules and legacy infrastructure shape user outcomes.  
**Role:** Design lead (research synthesis, pattern development, cross-team alignment)  
**Scope:** Cross-program work spanning intake, eligibility, verification, and service recovery  
**What changed:** Shared patterns and decision clarity methods adopted across multiple programs

## The problem

Government services fail at the moments that matter most: when someone needs help navigating a complex system under time pressure.

The issue wasn’t just bad interfaces. Eligibility systems, intake processes, and case management tools were built to satisfy policy compliance and processing volume—not to support completion, recovery from errors, or the downstream consequences of ambiguous decisions.

---

## Constraints

- Multi-program coordination across different technical stacks
- Policy requirements that couldn’t be changed (only interpreted and implemented)
- Legacy systems with limited or inconsistent integration points
- Stakeholders measuring success by throughput rather than completion/correctness
- High-risk error states: missing documents, misunderstood eligibility, dead ends

---

## My role

I led design work at the intersection of policy intent and delivery reality.

I was responsible for:
- synthesizing research signals into actionable patterns
- shaping decision-focused service language teams could share
- aligning multi-disciplinary stakeholders on what “success” meant in practice

---

## What I did

### 1) Mapped decision points + failure states
- Identified where people most commonly failed, abandoned, or got stuck
- Documented “drop-off” and “dead-end” moments as operational failures, not UX quirks

### 2) Defined consequence moments
- Flagged places where small design choices created downstream harm
- Made the cost of ambiguity visible: delays, rework, support burden, mistrust

### 3) Built a shared vocabulary across teams
- Established terms teams could use to debate service mechanics without bikeshedding UI
- Created critique prompts focused on decision clarity, recovery, and accountability

### 4) Developed intake patterns that prevent late-stage failure
- Built reusable patterns for surfacing requirements earlier
- Improved legibility of “what happens next” and “why this is needed”
- Prioritized recoverability over perfect happy-path flow

### 5) Aligned policy + delivery on measurable outcomes
- Shifted conversations from “processed” to “completed correctly”
- Connected service design choices to support load and operational performance

---

## Key decisions

- **Optimized for recoverability over polish**  
  Because dead ends are the true failure mode in high-stakes services.

- **Surfaced requirements earlier instead of hiding complexity**  
  Because late-stage surprises drive abandonment and increase rework.

- **Built patterns that travel across programs**  
  Because the real leverage is repeatability, not one-off fixes.

## Outcomes

- Patterns adopted across 4+ federal programs
- Reduced avoidable abandonment during intake and verification moments
- “Consequence mapping” approach reused in training and cross-team critique

## What this demonstrates

I can walk into complex, politically constrained delivery environments and find leverage points where design decisions create outsized impact.

I don’t need clean slates. I work inside real systems—policy constraints, legacy tooling, operational reality—and improve how decisions get made, communicated, and recovered from when they fail.
