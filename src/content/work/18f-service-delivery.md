## The problem

Government services often fail at the moments that matter most—when someone needs help navigating a complex system under time pressure. The challenge wasn't just bad interfaces; it was that eligibility systems, intake processes, and case management tools were designed around policy compliance, not human outcomes.

## Constraints

- Multi-agency coordination across different technical stacks
- Policy requirements that couldn't be changed, only interpreted
- Legacy systems with limited API access
- Stakeholders who measured success by processing volume, not user outcomes

## My role

Design lead responsible for research synthesis, pattern development, and cross-agency alignment.

## What I did

- Mapped decision points where users most commonly failed or abandoned processes
- Identified "consequence moments"—places where a design choice created downstream harm
- Created a shared vocabulary for cross-agency teams to discuss service failures
- Developed intake patterns that reduced abandonment by surfacing requirements earlier
- Built alignment between policy teams and delivery teams on what "success" meant

## Artifacts

## Outcomes

- Patterns adopted by 4+ federal programs
- Reduced average application abandonment
- Framework for "consequence mapping" now used in training

## What this demonstrates

I can walk into a complex, politically constrained environment and find leverage points where design decisions create outsize impact. I don't need clean slates—I work within systems.
