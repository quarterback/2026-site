## Snapshot

**Context:** Federal service delivery systems where rules, policy interpretation, and legacy tooling shape the user experience.  
**My role:** Design lead (research synthesis, pattern development, cross-team alignment)  
**What I improved:** Decision clarity + service completion in high-stakes intake moments  
**Proof of impact:** Patterns adopted across multiple programs

## The problem

Government services fail at the moments that matter most: when someone needs help navigating a complex system under time pressure.

The issue wasn’t only interface quality. It was that eligibility systems, intake flows, and case management tools were designed around compliance and processing volume—not human outcomes, error recovery, or downstream consequences.

---

## Constraints (the real world version)

- Multi-program coordination across different technical stacks
- Policy requirements that couldn’t be changed—only interpreted and implemented
- Legacy systems with limited integration ability
- Stakeholders measuring success by throughput, not completion or correctness

---

## What I did (the leverage points)

- Mapped decision points where people most commonly failed, stalled, or abandoned
- Identified “consequence moments” where design choices created downstream harm
- Created a shared vocabulary teams could use to discuss service failure modes
- Developed intake patterns that surfaced requirements earlier and reduced late-stage failure
- Aligned policy + delivery teams on what “success” meant operationally

## Outcomes

- Patterns adopted across 4+ programs
- Reduced avoidable abandonment during intake (especially at requirement/verification moments)
- “Consequence mapping” method reused for training and cross-team critique

---

## What this demonstrates

I can enter complex, politically constrained systems and find leverage points where small design decisions create outsized impact.

I don’t need a clean slate—I work inside constraints and improve the mechanics of delivery.
