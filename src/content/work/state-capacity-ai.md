## The problem

Most AI discourse about government focuses on either automation (replacing workers) or surveillance (monitoring citizens). There's a missing middle: how can AI help public institutions make better decisions, catch errors earlier, and serve people more effectively—without replacing human judgment?

## What I'm exploring

- Decision support systems that augment caseworkers, not replace them
- Error detection in complex eligibility determinations
- AI as a tool for identifying policy gaps and edge cases
- Responsible deployment in high-stakes public contexts

## The approach

Rather than treating AI as a replacement for human expertise, I'm investigating how these tools can surface patterns, flag inconsistencies, and help caseworkers navigate complex rule systems. The focus is on transparency, auditability, and maintaining human agency in final decisions.

## What this demonstrates

I'm actively working on the next generation of public sector technology challenges, not just documenting past work.
