## The problem

Most AI discourse about government focuses on either automation (replacing workers) or surveillance (monitoring citizens). There's a missing middle: how can AI help public institutions make better decisions, catch errors earlier, and serve people more effectively—without replacing human judgment?

## What I'm exploring

- Decision support systems that augment caseworkers, not replace them
- Error detection in complex eligibility determinations
- AI as a tool for identifying policy gaps and edge cases
- Responsible deployment in high-stakes public contexts

## What this demonstrates

I'm actively working on the next generation of public sector technology challenges, not just documenting past work.
