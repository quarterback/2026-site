## The catalyst

Following the closure of 18F, I wanted to establish a community-focused alternative for digital service work. I launched Portland Digital Corps expecting modest participation—but over 100 people signed up, with 50+ volunteers actively contributing.

## What we did

We assembled designers, developers, data visualization specialists, strategists, and product managers to rebuild websites for nonprofit organizations across Portland.

The team successfully rebuilt **six nonprofit websites** while partnering with local organizations including:
- Built Oregon
- OSU Uplift Lab
- Families for Safe Streets Oregon
- Cape Perpetua Collaborative

In-person events achieved strong attendance, indicating genuine community interest in collaborative digital service work.

## Community impact

Participants consistently reported valuing the opportunity to connect with professionals they might not otherwise meet. This relationship-building extended beyond the initial cohort, with volunteers expressing interest in future iterations.

Groups nationwide contacted us seeking to replicate the model in their respective cities. I plan to publish a "building a digital service" guide by end of 2025 to support similar initiatives elsewhere.

## What this demonstrates

I can organize cross-functional teams around public service work. I don't just design systems for institutions—I build the community infrastructure that makes collaborative delivery possible.
