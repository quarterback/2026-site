## Workshop format

A hands-on session where product and service teams learn to map the downstream consequences of their design decisions before shipping. Participants work through real scenarios to identify potential harms, edge cases, and system-level effects.

## What participants learned

- How to identify "consequence moments" in user flows
- Techniques for surfacing assumptions that lead to downstream harm
- Methods for evaluating tradeoffs when consequences conflict
- How to integrate consequence thinking into existing design processes

## Structure

### Part 1: Framework introduction (30 min)
Introduction to consequence design thinking and why good intentions aren't enough.

### Part 2: Case study analysis (45 min)
Participants analyzed real-world examples where design decisions created unintended harm:
- An eligibility screener that inadvertently locked people out
- A notification system that increased anxiety and support burden
- A data collection form that exposed vulnerable users

### Part 3: Applied exercise (60 min)
Teams mapped consequences for their own products using:
- Stakeholder impact grids
- Time-horizon mapping (immediate, 30 days, 6 months, 2 years)
- Edge case documentation
- Recovery path design

### Part 4: Sharing and critique (30 min)
Groups presented findings and received peer feedback.

## Outcomes

- Workshop rated 4.7/5 by participants
- Requested for repeat sessions at 3 additional organizations
- Materials adapted for internal team training at government agencies
- Led to follow-up consulting projects

## What this demonstrates

I can translate frameworks into practical tools that teams can use immediately. The workshop format balances theory with hands-on application, ensuring participants leave with actionable skills, not just concepts.
